# Requirements From You to Build Your Skill Set

This document outlines what I need from you to help build and refine your skills effectively. Providing these items will let me create clear instructions (`instructions.md`) and a focused skills plan (`skills.md`).

## 1) Your Goals and Context
- Your target role or outcome (e.g., frontend engineer, data analyst, tech lead).
- Time horizon for skill development (e.g., 3 months, 6 months, 1 year).
- Constraints or preferences (available hours per week, budget, learning style).
- Tools and platforms you can access or prefer to use.

## 2) Current Skill Snapshot
- What you already know (languages, frameworks, tools).
- Recent projects or work examples.
- Self-assessed proficiency levels for key areas.
- Certifications, courses, or workshops completed.

## 3) Target Skills and Topics
- Specific technologies, domains, or soft skills you want to prioritize.
- Must-have competencies vs. nice-to-have interests.
- Industry or niche focus (e.g., fintech, health tech, embedded).

## 4) Gaps and Pain Points
- Tasks you find difficult or slow.
- Repeated mistakes or areas with low confidence.
- Feedback from peers, managers, or users.

## 5) Learning Preferences and Constraints
- Preferred learning modes (hands-on projects, readings, videos, pair sessions).
- Time blocks available per week; planned cadence.
- Access limits (no paid courses, device constraints, offline needs).

## 6) Success Criteria and Measurement
- How we’ll measure progress (milestones, quizzes, code reviews, shipped features).
- Deadlines or checkpoints for key skills.
- Artifacts to produce (portfolio items, GitHub repos, case studies, presentations).

## 7) Project Ideas and Practice
- Domains or problem types you enjoy.
- Realistic project ideas that align with your goals.
- Data sources or APIs you can use; any proprietary data constraints.

## 8) Collaboration and Feedback
- How you want feedback delivered (written notes, calls, async comments).
- Frequency of check-ins and progress updates.
- Access to mentors or peers for reviews.

## 9) Constraints, Policies, and Ethics
- Company or institutional policies to respect (security, privacy, IP).
- Content or data restrictions.
- Accessibility or localization requirements for deliverables.

## 10) Logistics and Setup
- Development environment details (OS, editors/IDE, package managers).
- Accounts we can use (GitHub, cloud providers, learning platforms).
- Preferred repositories or folder structure for materials.
- Any compliance steps needed before sharing or storing data.

## 11) Outputs You Want
- Format and tone preferences for guides and exercises.
- Depth of detail (quick starts vs. deep dives).
- How to package deliverables (`instructions.md`, `skills.md`, checklists, templates).

## 12) Risks and Mitigations
- Known risks to timeline or motivation.
- Backup plans if a tool or resource isn’t available.
- How to handle blockers quickly.

## 13) Communication Details
- Time zone and availability windows.
- Primary communication channels.
- Response-time expectations.
